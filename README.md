About ISEKAI
ISEKAI: Manga to Motion AI is an innovative platform designed for creators who want to transcend the boundaries of traditional 2D storytelling. As a software developer with a focus on high-performance technology, you can appreciate the complex AI pipeline required to bridge the gap between static sketches and fluid, modern animation.

This project empowers artists and studios by providing a "luxury" animation experience that captures the "magical" essence of their original work. By focusing on cinematic realism and high-end visual aesthetics, it ensures that every transition from page to screen is both seamless and visually stunning.
